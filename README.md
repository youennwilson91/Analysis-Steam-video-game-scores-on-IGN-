1 - Here is an application allowing simple exploratory data analysis on pc video game reviews and gaming time.

2 - To run the application, import the files in your IDE, and run **streamlit run streamlit.py** in your terminal.

3 - This application was made by merging Steam data (downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamber/steam-video-games) with IGN data. IGN is a video game media and website. It regularly publishes video game analysis and reviews. IGN data was retrieved with web scrapping. Since Steam is a software only available on PC, the data scrapped from IGN covers only PC games.

4 - IGN usually makes review up to two weeks after a game is released. As a result, the release date and the review data are pretty close.
Since it might be confusing, each chart will have a little description attached.

5 - The dataset resulting from the merge of Steam and IGN data contains 892 rows, each row for a game. Due to insufficient data, reality is most likely to differ from the results shown here.
